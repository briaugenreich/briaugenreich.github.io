With the number of blogs out there (especially in tech) you can find yourself intimitaed by ideas, experiences, ____. And as scott stratten has said:

> ### “Too often, feeling intimidated becomes our excuse not to be awesome.”

So today my friends I embark on a journey to tackle a lot of initimateing challenges by starting a blog. Now this blog does not have much of a focus on topic. As i think through all of my interestes and exerpiences im excited to share i can see many topics coming from pen to paper. (hopefully im stitll a little on the slow side writing... ) I plan to mainly focus on my expreiences witth being a sforware engineer but From challenges in diviereity, teaching dance, technology, tooling, architecturer  , career growth, communication, yoga, hikes, working with others, expereinces books reviews, really any fucking thing that comes to mind.

 All these seemingly random ass topics will three main goals for me and you to get a little uncomrfotable and intimitadted in order to grow into the best damn human we can possibly be.

Somewhere add a link to about me... so i can ramble about myself.

## Learn / grow
I dont have all the asnwers and never claim to be tthe smartest most expert in the room (cause im not and asshole) So as i As i come accross new professional and eprsonal expereinces , tools, technologies no better way than explainnging thoughts to others to dolidify my understanding . Take on new tasks and challenge myself to understand and *clearly* explain the ideas.

 Challenge myself to become a better writter / communicator, I shy away from writing becuase then something is defined. What if im wrong, What if ___ what if ___ ? Well who gives a shit. Im finding my voice snadshareing  find my voice.

gain feedback - if i am wrong what a rgeat way to learn!

## Share  
Share these exeperinces for others to consume in a hopefully nonpretensionus way. Have you ever read a [stackvoerflow post]() twevle times and still walked away gping what the fuck? Somoe recent awesome leadership groups and work situations has helped me realzies that just because somoeone cant explain something simply does not make it complicated or make me stupid. So here i am hoping to help otthers feel embowered and ___ to learn / boost their kills.

I belive in the power of Shared expereinces reate and community . Battlyng isolation, inferoiryt, sterotypes, jerks, bad days, and inspirtation. That feeling that this is only happening to you and____ especially as a minitory or female and ive seen the value first hand how a community (inperson) can change the course of your trajectory and personal outlook (maybe ill share that)

## Remember / reflect

Finally this blog will help document my experiences for me to remmeber and reflect on all the good things ive come across.



So heres to a journey of you reading what is an attempt for me to be a blogger.
